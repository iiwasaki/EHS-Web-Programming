	<h4> About Me </h4>
	<p> First of all, thank you for wanting to know about me to click on this page. I am currently a student at the University 
		of Florida. My major is Computer Software Engineering, and I am also pursuing a UF Teach - Science minor. I also work with
		a great research group in the Astronomy department. I love space, computer stuff, teaching people, and sports. </p>
	<p> I have fortunately had the opportunity to intern in the past at the Florida Museum of Natural History here in Gainesville 
		and the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA. Through those internships I've really learned to enjoy teaching in an 
		informal setting, and I'm currently at a crossroads in my life where I have to decide what I want to do with my future.
		(If you have any input on the matter, please email me and guide me. I'm only half kidding.) </p>
	<p> My teaching philosophy revolves around the idea of computer science being taught as a way to think, not how to code. 
		Languages will come and go, and learning about the methods involved in arriving at an answer and the essential elements 
		of code is more important to me than being able to recite exact lines of C++ code off the top of your head. </p> 
	<p> I am a huge fan of the Boston Celtics, Miami Marlins, the Japanese National Football (the soccer kind) team, and 
		whatever NFL team my fantasy football team's QB plays for. I'm in the process of adopting an actual NFL team to root for
		as my favorite, though that will probably be the Seahawks once I move to Seattle. </p> 
	<p> I also love performing improv comedy with both Theatre Strike Force, the premier improv and sketch comedy troupe at the University of Florida, and 		the Treblemakers, the best (and only) musical improv comedy troupe at the University of Florida. I believe improv has been a key part of just 	about 	every bit of success I've had at this university. </p> 
	<p> Thanks for visiting, and enjoy your stay!</p>
