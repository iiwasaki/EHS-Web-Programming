       Since a was little i loved video games, the first game that i ever played was Halo: combat evolved for pc, the reason i started playing video games it was because of my dad.
       He got me into them when a was around 4 or 5 years old, getting older i got into gaming alot. Now that i'm even older i play even more, i call video games my medicine, beacuse every time i'm home sick or i don't fell good for other reasons i start playing and eventually a fell better, because it got me distracted from the problem. 
       Curently i play on ps4 and on Pc at GTA5 online, or Fallout, i also play other games but not as often
