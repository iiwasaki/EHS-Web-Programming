    <article>In the future, I am planning to take over the world. The plan begins when I graduate from high school. Instead of going to college and spending precious thousands of dllars, I will get a job as a programmer or software developer or the like. This, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of inherited stocks, will provide me with an adequate financial base to launch the next part of my plan. I will, using mone and family, acquire friends in high places to 'asist' with my stock market adventures. Using this to my advantage will be quick and relatively simple. After all this has beeen accomplished, the path to world domination becomes much murkier. Financing current conflicts would further the state of chaos in the world, which would further increase opportunities for an unscrupulous fellow to earn even more money. Once I have approximately a billion dollars, I will start to buy rams.</article>

    <article>I will then finance the genetic engineering of these rams to increase their speed, durability, and lethality. Increasing muscle and bone density and equipping the horns with remotely detonated explosive devices will make these rams a force to be reckoned with. With this army I can exploit the chaos and uncertainty of the world to unite it under one rule. My rule.</article>
