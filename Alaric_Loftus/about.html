    <center><p class="ex"><mark>Hi! My name is Alaric Loftus, (can't you tell?).Some of my likes include cold weather, pizza and sleeping in. Some of my dislikes incluse waking up early, spanish class, and excisive homework. My current hobby (I have many) is building, programming, and flying racing quadcopters. I also really enjoy general building/inovating and posting my findings on a webapp called Instructables. my scedual consistis of waking up at 6:30, going to school, going home, doing homework/studing for tests, and flying my quad. In the future I would like to go to UF and get my masters in mechanical engineering.</mark></p></center>
